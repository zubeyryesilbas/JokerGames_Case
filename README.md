#Joker Games Case Description - Mustafa ZÃ¼beyr Yesilbas .

#Introduction
I have developed this game using only assets found on the internet and the Unity Asset Store for the visuals. All the code, however, is entirely my creation. If you have any problems or questions, feel free to reach out to me.

#2. Dice Animation Creation System
Navigate to the Scene:
Go to Assets/Scenes/DiceAnimationCreation.
Rolling the Dice:
Click "Roll".
As soon as the dice finish rolling, two .csv files will be generated. These files contain the positions and rotations of the dice movements created physically.
Using the Dice Animator Editor:
Open the Dice Animator Editor via Tools > DiceAnimationEditor.
Attach each .csv file to the corresponding Text Asset field.
Rename the animation and create the dice animation.
Attach the generated animation to the animated dice to review the created animations.
Customizing Dice Rolling Physics:
To create unique dice rolling physics, you can edit the Roll method inside the Physical Dice script.
Adjust the spawn point and target point in the DicePhysicsController.
Using Created Animations in the Game:
To use the created animations in the game, copy and arrange the DiceFace component offsets on the dice in the scene.
It may be a bit complicated, but this method ensures a unique solution for creating deterministic animations.
Feel free to reach out for assistance.


#3.Game Design
I have implemented a character selection system where each character's bonus affects the player's earnings. Additionally, I have an idea to give each character a luck attribute that manipulates the probabilities of random dice faces, but this feature has not been implemented yet.
I have also created a "case" logic where players can attempt to multiply their earnings. However, if they fail, they risk losing everything. Players need to strategize on when to save their earnings.
If I were in charge of developing this game further, I would suggest the following enhancements:
Save Case Tickets:
Introduce save case tickets, which players can use to secure their earnings, adding a strategic twist to the gameplay.
This mechanic can also be monetized, providing an additional revenue stream for the game.
These features would add depth to the game, offering players more choices and enhancing the overall gaming experience.

This version provides a clear and concise explanation of the current game design and potential future enhancements, making it easy for others to understand your ideas and suggestions.
